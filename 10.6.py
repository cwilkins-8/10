#10.6 Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
#occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
#the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for
#two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if
#either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
#program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
#number

try:
    x = input ("Please input a number: ")
    x = int(x)
    y = input("Please input a different number: ")
    y = int(y)

except ValueError:
    print("Sorry, please enter a number not text.")

else:
    sum = x + y
    print("The sum of " + str(x) + " and " + str(y) + " is " + str(sum))
